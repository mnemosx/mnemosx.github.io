## Mežāži - website for a local bussiness

**Project description:**  
This is an older project where I practiced not only my HTML and CSS skills, but my design skills as well. The site was never finished and never launched due to some difficulties launching the business itself.  

The interactive parts of site are done with bits and pieces of jQuery code here and there.  

Overall this project should not be considered as an example of my current skills, I have included it in this list purely for displaying my path to web dev world.
